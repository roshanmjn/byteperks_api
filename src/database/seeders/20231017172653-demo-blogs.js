This ensured I didn’t get incorrect details. The chatbot even cites sources for verification. There is also a&nbsp;<strong>built-in image generator</strong>&nbsp;when you quickly need a photo.

Claude 2</h2><p>ChatGPT has no shortage of rivals in the AI space. Enter Claude 2, an upgraded AI chatbot by the company&nbsp;<strong>Anthropic</strong>. The company has been backed by Google, making it an OpenAI competitor. Claude doesn’t use an LLM model in the traditional sense. It instead uses a collection of what it calls “<strong>proprietary AI techniques</strong>” that include a neural network, training data, and more. This is focused more on natural conversation. This makes Claude a helpful, harmless, and honest bot for use.</p><p><img src=''https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Claude-2-.jpg?w=640&amp;quality=75'' alt=''a screenshot showing Claude 2 interface'' height=''589'' width=''640''></p><p>While initially accessible only through Slack, Claude is now available in over&nbsp;<strong>95 countries&nbsp;</strong>for free use. The AI chatbot by itself is capable of a lot. This ranges from simple conversations to writing complex codes, solving riddles, telling jokes, and more. Users can even&nbsp;<strong>upload compatible files</strong>&nbsp;and ask Claude to summarize them for ease of use. Furthermore, the best part is that the bot replies are lightning-fast and effortless.</p><p>However, do note that&nbsp;<strong>Claude 2 cannot access the Internet</strong>&nbsp;and is limited by its data. Claude also sometimes struggles with mathematical problems, so double-check your answer. Nonetheless, try it out and let us know what you think.</p><p><strong><em>Key Features:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>100k context window, Can load libraries of books, comparable to the GPT-4 model, Upload PDF files, Cheaper than GPT-4, Safe to use LLM</em></p><p>ProsConsFully free to use for nowCannot access the InternetQuick response time</p><p><a href=''https://claude.ai/chats'' rel=''noopener noreferrer'' target=''_blank'' style=''color: rgb(77, 178, 236);''><strong>Try</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;Claude 2</strong></p><h2>6. HuggingChat</h2><p>One of the best open-source ChatGPT alternatives, HuggingChat is an AI chatbot created by HuggingFace, one of the premier websites hosting many AI services. This chatbot was previously based on the&nbsp;<strong>Meta AI (LLaMA)</strong>&nbsp;LLM but has since evolved where it lets you choose from a variety of language models. This includes not just Llama but also other LLMs like Mistral 7B and Falcon 180B. To help sort this, HuggingChat has the option for&nbsp;<strong>multiple chats</strong>.</p><p><img src=''https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/HuggingChat.jpg?w=582&amp;quality=75'' alt=''A screenshot showing HuggingChat''s interface '' height=''560'' width=''582''></p><p>HuggingChat can do everything ChatGPT would. It can write interesting blog posts and jokes, curate HTML code for websites, give you recipes, and much more. There is also a handy toggle to enable&nbsp;<strong>web access</strong>. This will allow the bot to gather information online to supplement its answer. However, the bot has network errors from time to time, which might hinder you. Nonetheless, try this ChatGPT alternative the next time the former goes down.</p><p><strong><em>Key Features:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>Multiple model selection,</em>&nbsp;<em>Supports web access, Good for coding,</em></p><p>ProsConsFast and snappy repliesProne to network errorsUsers can choose from multiple LLMSCan perform a variety of functionsCan search the web</p><p><a href=''https://huggingface.co/chat/'' rel=''noopener noreferrer'' target=''_blank'' style=''color: rgb(77, 178, 236);''><strong>Try</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;HuggingChat</strong></p><h2>7. Pi, your personal AI</h2><p>Among all the other ChatGPT alternatives, Pi is possibly the only one that will provide you with a different experience altogether. Based on being a supportive and smart AI, Pi is a chatbot that follows a unique design. Instead of full-blown chats, conversations on Pi happen dialogue by dialogue. What makes it more interesting is that Pi is also one of the only assistants who talks back. The website has six different voices; each is&nbsp;<strong>eerily realistic and oddly comforting</strong>.</p><p><img src=''https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pi.jpg?w=640&amp;quality=75'' alt=''Pi personal AI interface'' height=''270'' width=''640''></p><p>Pi starts the conversation itself and tries to glean in every message you send. Speaking something like how a therapist would, the ChatGPT alternative is quite inquisitive and tries to understand and respond in kind. One could almost start to forget this is an AI if not for the occasional errors. So, while it can get tedious if you keep talking, Pi is one of the best ChatGPT alternatives if you want some mental relief. However, you need an account and a working phone number to sign up, which can be a downside for some. Nonetheless, check it out.</p><p><strong><em>Key Features:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>Personal AI chatbot, Speaks like a therapist, Engaging and conversational</em></p><p>ProsConsQuite effective at mental health conversationsNeeds a phone number to sign upRealistic and comforting voiceOccasional speech errors</p><p><a href=''https://heypi.com/talk'' rel=''noopener noreferrer'' target=''_blank'' style=''color: rgb(77, 178, 236);''><strong>Try</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;Pi, your personal AI</strong></p><h2>8. GitHub Copilot X</h2><p>Students are not the only ones who can benefit from tools like ChatGPT.&nbsp;<strong>Github Copilot X</strong>&nbsp;is the company’s solution for programmers at their wit’s end. Copilot is based on the concept of auto-completion but goes much further than that. The tool helps programmers by suggesting and completing code and entire functions in real time. Consider Copilot X as a tool to help with programmers’ block.</p><p>Github Copilot is on&nbsp;<strong>OpenAI’s latest&nbsp;</strong><a href=''https://beebom.com/openai-gpt-4-new-features-image-input-how-to-use/'' rel=''noopener noreferrer'' target=''_blank'' style=''color: rgb(77, 178, 236);''><strong>GPT-4</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;model&nbsp;</strong>and has been&nbsp;<strong>trained on millions of lines of code</strong>.

OpenAI Playground</h2><p>From the start, it is worth noting that OpenAI Playground is a tool&nbsp;<strong>not meant for daily users</strong>. However, if you find yourself locked out of ChatGPT and still want a taste of its capabilities, OpenAI Playground is the way to go. This web-based tool works like ChatGPT but provides much more advanced options, including selecting<strong>&nbsp;a specific language model</strong>&nbsp;to experiment with. Once you have selected the model, you can tinker with other factors such as the model’s randomness, number of tokens, frequency penalty, stop sequences, and more. ChatGPT Plus users can even choose the latest GPT-4 LLM.</p><p><img src=''https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Open-AI-.jpg?w=640&amp;quality=75'' alt=''Open AI playground interface'' height=''338'' width=''640''></p><p>Since OpenAI Playground is simply a demo version of the ChatGPT service, its outputs are on par with ChatGPT and give a good feel of the actual service.

However, be aware that you might lose access, just like ChatGPT, if the server is in high demand.</p><p><strong><em>Key Features:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>Lots of model customization</em>s,&nbsp;<em>Access to various models, Upload audio recording, Free to use</em></p><p>ProsConsSpoiled for choice with language learning modelsNot for everyday usersChatGPT level accuracy and response speedMight lose access in high demand</p><p><a href=''https://beta.openai.com/playground'' rel=''noopener noreferrer'' target=''_blank'' style=''color: rgb(77, 178, 236);''><strong>Try</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;OpenAI Playground</strong></p><h2>10. Quora Poe</h2><p>Introduced in early 2023, Poe by Quora is not an AI itself but more of a&nbsp;<strong>platform</strong>&nbsp;where you can talk to AI bots. Poe stands for ‘<em>Platform for Open Exploration</em>.’ True to its name, Quora Poe is a place where users can talk to and experiment with various AI chatbots. Quora mentions that Poe lets people ask questions, get instant answers, and have back-and-forth conversations with several AI-powered bots.</p><p><img src=''https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Quora-Poe-.jpg?w=640&amp;quality=75'' alt=''Quora Poe interface'' height=''425'' width=''640''></p><p>Poe’s website is neatly packaged and currently allows users to talk with AIs like Sage, ChatGPT, Dragonfly,<strong>&nbsp;and even GPT-4 and Claude+</strong>. All told, the platform allows access to&nbsp;<strong>over 20 different LLMs</strong>. However, access is limited for the last two, so you must get a subscription for the same. For those thinking that Poe is an AI chatbot that is going to use the question-answer data on Quora, you can rest easy as that’s not the case.</p><p>Quora Poe works extremely well and has little to no downtime while you talk away with the various AI bots. However, you do need to create an account to access it. Thankfully, you don’t need to create separate accounts for all services, so that’s the bright side. If you’re the sort who loves all these ChatGPT-like tools but can’t be bothered to open them all, Poe can be your one-stop platform for them.</p><p><strong><em>Key Features:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>One-stop platform for various models, Supports GPT-4, Claude, and more, Easy to use, No downtime</em></p><p>ProsConsAll-in-one platform to access almost all AI botsLimited access to GPT-4Little to no downtime</p><p><a href=''https://poe.com/chatgpt'' rel=''noopener noreferrer'' target=''_blank'' style=''color: rgb(77, 178, 236);''><strong>Try</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;Quora Poe&nbsp;</strong>(<a href=''https://apps.apple.com/us/app/poe-fast-ai-chat/id1640745955?platform=iphone'' rel=''noopener noreferrer'' target=''_blank'' style=''color: rgb(77, 178, 236);''>iOS</a>/<a href=''https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.poe.android'' rel=''noopener noreferrer'' target=''_blank'' style=''color: rgb(77, 178, 236);''>Android</a>)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</strong></p><p><strong>1. What are AI Chatbots?</strong></p><p>For those unaware, AI chatbots are virtual programs and apps designed to&nbsp;<strong>simulate human conversation</strong>. To break it down even further, AI chatbots make users feel like they’re talking to another human instead of bots. Ever since the rise of ChatGPT, AI chatbots have vastly increased in quantity. Besides talking, AI chatbots can do a lot of other things, including writing essays, solving calculations, and more. As mentioned in the piece, a lot of ChatGPT alternatives here function as full-fledged AI chatbots. So you can go ahead and have conversations with these bots and have them respond in kind.</p><p><strong>2. Is There Any Ultimate Alternative to ChatGPT?</strong></p><p>While we have listed many ChatGPT alternatives above, we wouldn’t classify any of them as the ultimate solution. Depending on how you are as a user, one alternative might be more suitable for you than the other. So, whether it’s a ChatGPT alternative for coders, writers, or even people with simple search engine queries, there’s something for everyone.</p><p><strong>3. Is There a Free Version of ChatGPT?</strong></p><p>ChatGPT itself is&nbsp;<strong>free to use and experiment with by anyone</strong>. However, users who want to try out the new GPT-4 model must pay $20 monthly to access it. This will not only give them a better language model but no downtime. Check out&nbsp;<a href=''https://beebom.com/how-get-gpt-4-right-now/'' rel=''noopener noreferrer'' target=''_blank'' style=''color: rgb(77, 178, 236);''>how to get access to GPT-4 right now</a>&nbsp;and get started.</p><p><strong>4. What is ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis?</strong></p><p>Previously known as the Code Interpreter, the Advanced Data Analysis is a separate mode for the bot that enables users to upload any kind of code or data and have ChatGPT analyze it. So, if you’re a programmer with code to debug, you can use this mode provided you have the ChatGPT Plus subscription.</p><p><strong>5. What Is Google’s Equivalent of ChatGPT?</strong></p><p>Google has worked on several different language models in the past. The list includes models like BERT, MUM, and LaMDA. However, Google’s latest and most fitting ChatGPT equivalent is Bard. As mentioned above,&nbsp;<strong>Google Bard</strong>&nbsp;is an experimental conversational AI service. However, it’s equally powerful with multiple features like access to the Internet, extension support, citing sources, multimodal help, and much more.</p><p><strong>6. Is Google Bard better than ChatGPT?</strong></p><p>While both ChatGPT and Google Bard are capable AI bots, calling one better over the other wouldn’t necessarily be correct. Both the AI chatbots come with their own set of nuances that users love. So, while Google Bard comes with multiple drafts and sources for variety, some absolutely love GPT-4s speed and data. So, as is with everything in life, your mileage may vary.</p>', 'https://picsum.photos/201', 7, 200, 'Science', 'blog', 'bard ai, google, chatgpt\n', 'You must have seen how explodingly popular ChatGPT has become on the internet.
